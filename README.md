# BF Toolkit

A set of compilers, interpreters, and apps for everyone's favorite esoteric programming language.

## Swift
Includes an optimizing interpreter and compiler to many languages (Currently C, Python, Java, Swift,
OS X x86\_64 assembly, and MIPS assembly.) Also includes an iOS app and tvOS app for compiling and interpreting
the language.

## C
Includes just a basic, very fast, non-optimizing interpreter in 112 lines.

## Haskell
Includes an optimizing interpreter that's better than the Swift one, and a compiler to C, OS X x86\_64 assembly, and [Hasm](https://github.com/harlanhaskins/hasm)

Why do I do these things?
